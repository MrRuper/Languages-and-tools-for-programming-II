# What is this?

This are modified notes from the third laboratory of "Introduction to the Machine Learning" course provided by dr Andrzej Mizera.

# What is the goal of that laboratory?
The goal is to show:

- Pandas and Seaborn libraries which are very helpful in data analysis (plotting tables, plotting different relationships between several datasets).

- Iris data: this is the standard dataset with 3 types of flowers (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica). Each of the flower is described by 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.

- Logistic regression: we would like to predict wheter new flower belongs to Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica based only on Iris data we have, to do so we use the Logistic regression. This model uses a gradient descent method for sigmoid function. You can use already implemented function from sklearn library or you can look at "Manual fitting of the logistic regression model" section in the [logistic_regression_iris.ipynb](https://github.com/MrRuper/Languages-and-tools-for-programming-II/blob/main/laboratory_3/logistic_regression_iris.ipynb).

- ROC curve, AUC ("area" under a ROC curve) and confusion matrix (with accuracy score) - these are parameters which describe how good our model is in the sense of how good our model predicts. 

# Note!

There is a huge Warning in the output Out[6] probably because of some update. I have no idea how to hide this warning without hiding the plot so please just **ignore** this warning.

# Why Jupyter?

I discovered that Jupyter is incredibly user-friendly, effectively organizing distinct code segments into logical blocks. From now on I will use it for my future notes / projects.

# What does this folder contain?

This folder contains: <br>
- [ionosphere.data.csv](https://github.com/MrRuper/Languages-and-tools-for-programming-II/blob/main/laboratory_1/ionosphere.data.csv) - here is data we work with (each row has 34 attributes and the last column is the label which means to which class this object belongs).
- [ionosphere.names.csv](https://github.com/MrRuper/Languages-and-tools-for-programming-II/blob/main/laboratory_1/ionosphere.names.csv) - here is the description of ionosphere database and it's history. 
- [laboratory_part1.py](https://github.com/MrRuper/Languages-and-tools-for-programming-II/blob/main/laboratory_1/laboratory_part1.py) - here is first part of laboratory. It shows how to work with such data in python (i.e. reading and saving ionosphere data, finding the average and standard deviation of rows, finding attributes of the object which are less than the expected value of this object).
- [laboratory_part2.py](https://github.com/MrRuper/Languages-and-tools-for-programming-II/blob/main/laboratory_1/laboratory_part2.py) - here the sigmoid 2D function is defined and plotted.
